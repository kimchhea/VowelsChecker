this function use for check vowels consonant and total alphabet
-it work by condition
for (var i = 0; i < text.length; i++) {
    // it run loop depend on the length or index od the text that we put
    include (value) is a bult in function that can check value in array  and then chek that it include in vowel or not
      if (vowel.includes(text[i])) {
        totalcount += 1;
      }
}
when the loop run threw the by the length  of the value of text area that we input and start to check that does the text in text[i] is has value or include in vowels or not if it has it will add value to totalcount +1
 but if it dont it will checl second condition that if the text of [i]  has value that start from a and finish on z it will consider it as consonant and it will add totalconsonant to +1 and the last is just plus total vowel with total consonant to find total alphabet
 -it has functions : Find , Delete 
 - user friendly : it know what it letter alreadt show event you number in it still work :)
